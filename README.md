## Disclaimer

> This roadmap aims to give you an idea about the landscape. The road map will guide you if you need clarification about what to learn next rather than encouraging you to pick what is hype and trendy. It would help if you grew some understanding of why one tool would be better suited for some cases than the other and remember that hype and trendy only sometimes mean best suited for the job.

## Understanding the .NET ecosystem

Before going into specifics, you need to have a solid understanding of the **.NET Ecosystem**. Here are a few that you should understand:

## .NET runtimes

In this section, we will look at the main .NET runtimes. We consider .NET runtime as anything that implements **[ECMA-335 Standard for .NET](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/docs/project/dotnet-standards.md)**.

### .NET Framework

[.NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework) is a software development framework for building and running applications on Windows. .NET Framework consists of Common Language Runtime (CLR), .NET Framework Class Library, and Application workloads (WPF, Windows Forms, and ASP.NET). CLR is part of a shared infrastructure that runs code, jit, does garbage collection (C#, VB.NET, F#), etc. The code that CLR manages is called managed code. Code is compiled into Common Intermediate Language (CIL) and stored in assemblies (with .exe or .dll extension). When an application runs, CLR takes an assembly and uses a just-in-time compiler (JIT) to transpile machine code into code that can run on specific computer architecture.

You can use it for both desktop and web development, but it is limited to Windows development, and it comes preinstalled on Windows.

### .NET Core

[.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) is one of the runtimes in the .NET Ecosystem. It was released in 2016. and it's [open-sourced](https://github.com/dotnet/core). It was built from scratch as a cross-platform, modular runtime rather than as a new version of .NET Framework. Since .NET 5, it is the only line under active development: .NET Framework 4.8.1 is the final version and receives only security and reliability fixes. .NET Core consists of an App Host (dotnet.exe) that runs CLR and Library. It has a Common language runtime (CoreCLR) and .NET Core Class Library. It supports different application workloads, such as ASP.NET Core (MVC and API), console applications, and UWP.

.NET Core can run on different platforms: Windows Client, Server, IoT, Linux, Ubuntu, FreeBSD, Tizen, and Mac OSX, and can be installed side-by-side of different versions per machine or user.


### The One .NET - .NET 5

[.NET 5](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/5.0) was released in November 2020 with the goal of unifying development for desktop, Web, cloud, mobile, gaming, IoT, and AI applications. The earlier setup goal was to produce a single .NET runtime and framework, cross-platform, integrating the best features of .NET Core, .NET Framework, Xamarin, and Mono. However, due to the global health pandemic, the unification was postponed to .NET 6. .NET 5 is a shared code base for .NET Core, Mono, Xamarin, and future .NET implementations. Also, target framework names (TFMs), which express which version of .NET targeting, are updated, so we now have net5.0. This is for code that runs everywhere. It combines and replaces the netcoreapp and netstandard names and net5.0-windows that represent OS-specific flavors of .NET 5 that include net5.0 plus OS-specific bindings.

### The current - .NET 10

[.NET 10](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-10/overview) is the latest runtime in the .NET Ecosystem. It was released in November 2025, and it unifies development for desktop, Web, cloud, mobile, gaming, IoT, and AI applications. .NET 10 consists of an App Host (dotnet.exe) that runs CLR and Library. It has a Common language runtime (CoreCLR) and the .NET 10 Class Library. It also includes ASP.NET Core 10 and EF Core 10. .NET 10 brings runtime improvements (JIT inlining, devirtualization, stack allocations, AVX10.2, NativeAOT enhancements), new library APIs, and expanded post-quantum cryptography support.

.NET 10 is a **Long Term Support (LTS)** release, supported for three years (until November 2028).

.NET 9 was a **Standard Term Support (STS)** release, supported for two years after the initial release (until November 2026). STS releases are supported for 24 months; LTS releases for a minimum of three years. Releases alternate between LTS and STS.

**What's next:** [.NET 11](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-11/overview) is in preview and ships in November 2026 as an STS release, together with [C# 15](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-15) and [EF Core 11](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-11.0/whatsnew). Headline changes are runtime-native async, Zstandard compression in ASP.NET Core, vector search in EF Core, and union types in C#.

![C#/NET Timeline](CSharp-NET_Timeline.png)

## .NET Standard

Different runtimes use different class libraries, e.g., .NET Framework uses .NET Framework class library, while .NET Core contains its class library, as well as Xamarin with its class library. In this way, it's hard to share code between different runtimes, as they use different APIs. Microsoft's solution is the **.NET Standard library**, released in 2016. It represents a set of (formal) specifications that say which APIs you can use and all runtimes implement it. It is the evolution of Portable Class Libraries (PCL). Specific runtimes implement specific versions of .NET Standard (implementing specific APIs). E.g., .NET Framework 4.8.1 implements .NET Standard 2.0, and .NET 10 implements .NET Standard 2.1 ([link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard?tabs=net-standard-1-0#net-implementation-support)). .NET Standard 2.1 is the final version; for code targeting modern .NET only, target the `net10.0` TFM directly instead.

## Learning resources

### 1. C#

C# is a programming language developed by Microsoft. It's a language for building anything from desktop applications and games (using Unity) to cloud-based solutions and web services. With **strong support for object-oriented programming** and a rich library, it's designed to be easy and efficient. 

The latest version is **[C# 14](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-14)**, released in November 2025 with .NET 10. Notable recent additions include [extension members](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-14#extension-members), the [`field` keyword](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-14#the-field-keyword), [null-conditional assignment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-14#null-conditional-assignment), first-class `Span<T>` conversions, and `partial` constructors/events. [C# 15](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-15) is in preview and ships with .NET 11 in November 2026, bringing union types, closed hierarchies, extension indexers, and labeled `break`/`continue`.

Check the full C# timeline:

### 3. ASP.NET Core 

It is a cross-platform, high-performance framework developed by Microsoft for **building web apps, APIs, and microservices**. You can also run your apps on Windows, Linux, or macOS. It's engineered for flexibility and scalability with features like built-in dependency injection and a robust configuration system.

Here, you also need to know **web development fundamentals**, such as:

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end development
- HTTP protocols, DNS, request/response model, and RESTful APIs
- Routing, middleware, authentication, and authorization

Note that **Minimal APIs** are now preferred for lightweight APIs, instead of controllers.

### 4. Client-Side .NET

If you want to build UIs in .NET, you will need these frameworks. **Razor** is a template engine for creating dynamic HTML, while **Blazor** takes it up a notch, letting you build interactive web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript. **MAUI** is a Xamarin successor made for building cross-platform mobile apps. **Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)** is a UI framework that creates desktop client applications. **Uno Platform** is an open-source cross-platform UI framework that allows developers to build single-codebase applications for Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and Web (via WebAssembly) using .NET.

**Resources**:

- [Razor](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/mvc/views/razor)
- [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor)
  - [Render modes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/components/render-modes) (static SSR, Server, WebAssembly, Auto)
- [.NET MAUI](https://github.com/dotnet/maui)
- [WPF](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/wpf/overview/?view=netdesktop-10.0)
- [WinUI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/winui/winui3/)
- [Uno Platform](https://platform.uno/)
- [Avalonia](https://avaloniaui.net/)
- Note: [UWP](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/universal-application-platform-guide) and [WinForms](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/winforms/overview/?view=netdesktop-10.0) are also used client-side .NET technologies, though they are in maintenance mode (no major new investment).

### 5. Databases

Good database design ensures efficient data storage and quick retrieval, making your app run smoother and scale easier. **SQL**, the go-to language for database interaction, gives you the power to query, update, and manage the data you've so carefully designed to store.

Here, you need to know:

- SQL Syntax

### 6. ORM

Object-relational mapping (ORM) is like a translator between your object-oriented C# code and the relational database, eliminating the tedious task of writing SQL queries for basic CRUD operations. Using ORM frameworks like Entity Framework, you can **manipulate data as objects in your code, making it more readable and maintainable**. This speeds up development, minimizes errors, and lets you focus on complex business logic rather than wrestling with database syntax.

For **Entity Framework**, you need to know the following:

- DbContext and DbSet for managing database connections and querying data
- Code-First and Database-First approaches for defining data models
- Migrations for managing database schema changes
- Querying data using LINQ and raw SQL
- Tracking changes and saving data

### 9. Communication

In .NET we have three types of communication: Real-time communication, Synchronous, and Asynchronous communication. **Real-time communication** technologies, like SignalR in the .NET ecosystem, enable these functionalities by maintaining a constant connection between server and client. **Synchronous communication** is mainly done by using through HTTP Client, while **asynchronous communication** is done through different messaging and event-based frameworks and libraries. Messaging systems act as a middleman between different parts of your system, allowing them to communicate without being directly connected. **Event handlers**, on the other side, are used for handling events within a single application. They facilitate a publisher-subscriber model where one part of the application can raise an event that other parts can react to.

### 14. Cloud

Cloud providers provide a layer of APIs to abstract infrastructure and provision it based on security and billing boundaries. The cloud **runs on servers in data centers**, but the abstractions cleverly give the appearance of interacting with a single "platform" or large application. The ability to quickly provision, configure, and secure resources with cloud providers has been key to the tremendous success and complexity of modern DevOps.

The most popular cloud providers in the market are **AWS** and **Azure**, as well as **Google Cloud**.

Also, Microsoft offers **Aspire** (formerly .NET Aspire) to simplify cloud-native and microservices development with orchestration, service discovery, and a developer dashboard. It now ships on its own cadence (Aspire 13.x), decoupled from the .NET release schedule.

Here, you must know how to manage users and administration, networks, virtual servers, etc.

### 16. AI & Machine Learning

AI & Machine Learning enable software to learn from data, recognize patterns, and generate insights without explicit programming. In the .NET ecosystem, AI is increasingly used for automation, predictions, recommendations, and natural language processing.

While traditional machine learning relies on structured data and models, modern AI advances—such as large language models (LLMs)—enable applications to understand and generate human-like text, images, and code. The .NET ecosystem now has first-class abstractions for building LLM-powered apps, RAG pipelines, and agentic workflows that integrate with OpenAI, Azure, and local models.

For a .NET developer, key areas to understand include:

- Basic Machine Learning concepts – classification, regression, and neural networks
- AI-powered applications – using LLMs, chatbots, and intelligent search
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) – embeddings, vector search, and grounding LLMs on your data
- Agents & tool calling – function/tool calling, orchestration, and the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Cloud AI Services – leveraging Azure AI Foundry and OpenAI APIs

### 17. .NET Libraries

Some useful .NET libraries. Note that not all libraries will be used by everyone, it mainly depends on a project you work on.

- **[MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR)** – Mediator pattern implementation in .NET. (Now under a **commercial license** for most production use; not recommended -> manual handlers are better)
  - **[Mediator](https://github.com/martinothamar/Mediator)** – Source-generated, MIT-licensed alternative to MediatR.
- **[Polly](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly)** – Fault-handling library that allows expressing policies such as Retry and Circuit Breaker.
- **[Benchmark.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet)** – .NET library for benchmarking.
- **[YARP](https://microsoft.github.io/reverse-proxy/)** – Reverse proxy server.
- **OpenAPI / API documentation** – ASP.NET Core ships [built-in OpenAPI document generation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/openapi/overview) (`Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi`); Swashbuckle is no longer in the default .NET 9+ templates.
  - **[Scalar](https://github.com/scalar/scalar)** – Modern, interactive API reference UI (a popular Swagger UI replacement). -> Recommended
  - **[NSwag](https://github.com/RicoSuter/NSwag)** – OpenAPI/Swagger toolchain with client code generation.
  - **[Swashbuckle](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore)** – Classic Swagger tooling for ASP.NET Core (community-maintained).
- **[FluentValidation](https://github.com/JeremySkinner/FluentValidation)** – The most popular library for building strongly-typed validation rules with fluent syntax.
- **Object Mapping** – Libraries for transforming between domain models, DTOs, and view models:
  - **[AutoMapper](https://github.com/AutoMapper/AutoMapper)** – Convention-based mapping using profiles. (Now under a **commercial license** for most production use; not recommended -> use manual mapping)
  - **[Mapster](https://github.com/MapsterMapper/Mapster)** – Lightweight, fast, and flexible.
  - **[Mapperly](https://github.com/riok/mapperly)** – Compile-time, source generator-based mapper for performance and type safety. (better alternative to AutoMapper)
- **[Humanizer](https://github.com/Humanizr/Humanizer)** – Turns strings, enums, dates, and numbers into human-readable text.
- **[CsvHelper](https://github.com/JoshClose/CsvHelper)** – Read and write CSV files.

## Additional considerations

In addition to this, you also need to know the following:

### Performance best practices

Performances play an essential role in .NET applications. Here you need to know:

#### Profiling and diagnostics

These tools can help you identify and debug different performance bottlenecks you have in your code. For this, you can use other tools, such as:

- [PerfView](https://joshthecoder.com/2023/10/23/using-perfview-to-diagnose-high-cpu-in-an-aspnet-app.html)
- [Visual Studio Profiler](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/profiling/profiling-feature-tour?view=vs-2022)
- [dotTrace](https://www.jetbrains.com/profiler/) and [dotMemory](https://www.jetbrains.com/dotmemory/)
- [dotnet-counters, dotnet-trace, and dotnet-dump](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/diagnostics/tools-overview) - cross-platform CLI diagnostics

#### Performances 101

Along with tools, you should be aware of different performance best practices for .NET:

- **Caching** (in-mem Memory Cache or Redis)

- **Database Optimization** (optimize queries, proper indexing, connection pooling)

- **Async Programming** (offload all CPU extensive or I/O bound operations to DB, file systems, ext. systems)

- **Use Entity Framework wisely** (use eager loading, projections, and optimizations like compiled queries)

- **Memory management** (use value types and be cautious with large object graphs. Use dispose pattern to db connections or streams. Avoid boxing/unboxing. Use StringBuilder instead of String for a large number of concatenations.)

- **HTTP Caching** (use ETags, Last-Modified headers)

- **Minimize Round-Trips** (reduce the number of HTTP requests and database round-trips)

- **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)** (Offload static assets (CSS, JavaScript, images) to CDNs for faster delivery to users)

- **Compression** (Enable GZIP or Brotli compression for HTTP responses to reduce data transfer size)

- **Logging and Tracing** (Avoid excessive logging in production. Use distributed tracing across microservices.)

- **Parallelism and Concurrency** (Utilize parallelism and multithreading for CPU-bound tasks using Parallel class or Task Parallel Library (TPL))

- **Resource Optimization** (Optimize images and assets for the Web to reduce load times)

- **HTTP2 over SSL** (now make intelligent decisions about the page content)

- **Measure and Monitor Performance** (use VS Diagnostic Tools, App Insights, or BenchmarkDotNet)

- **Use Span<> instead of collections** (spans can represent a contiguous section of memory; this means we can use them to operate over arrays)

- **Native AOT and trimming** (publish ahead-of-time compiled, self-contained apps for faster startup and a smaller footprint)

Check more about performances in the [Awesome .NET Performance](https://github.com/adamsitnik/awesome-dot-net-performance) repo.

### Security and Cryptography

Security plays an essential role in application development. The most critical aspects of security in the .NET world are:

- [**Authentication and Authorization**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-api/overview/security/authentication-and-authorization-in-aspnet-web-api) concepts:
  - Cookies
  - ASP.NET Core Identity for user management
  - .NET OIDC middleware
  - OAuth and OpenID Connect for 3rd-party authentication
  - JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for token-based authentication
  - Role-based and claims-based authorization

- [**Cryptography and Data Protection**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/security/cross-platform-cryptography) concepts:
  - Symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms
  - .NET Core Data Protection APIs
  - Hashing and digital signatures
  - Secure random number generation

- **Web hardening** concepts:
  - [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)
  - [CORS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/cors)
  - [CSRF protection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/anti-request-forgery)
  - [HTTPS and HSTS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/enforcing-ssl)
  - Secrets management ([User Secrets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets) locally, [Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/key-vault) in production)
  - Dependency auditing ([NuGet Audit](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/concepts/auditing-packages))
